# Ludum Dare: my base-code (in Odin)

This is the base codebase for my attempts at Ludum Dare (in Odin). It is a
work-in-progress, not usable by anyone else yet.

## Setup

### Windows

Setup the symlink that VSCode will need to open the workspace file:

```
 cmd /c mklink /d odin-source C:\dev\odin\dev-master
 cmd /c mklink /d raylib-source C:\Users\will\Code\source\raylib
```
